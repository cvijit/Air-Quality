# Air-Quality
Prediction of air quality in an Italian city using multiple linear regression and support vector regression

The objective is to predict the relative humidity based on the factors which had impact on the temperature and the air around. The hourly response on the dataset was recorded using an analyzer. Missing values were graphically plotted and the variable NMHC.GT which had more than 90 percent missing values was removed. After analysing the data, the entire dataset was splitted into 70 and 30 percent train and test data. The important variables were observed and regression methods was carried out to deal with multicollinearity.
